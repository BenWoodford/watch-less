watch-less is a simple command line tool that will watch a directory tree and output compiled a .css file whenever a .less file is changed.

I recomend installing globally for ease of use.

[code]
    sudo npm install -g watch-less
[/code]

using it is as simple as:

[code]
    watch-less
[/code]

to see various options use

[code]
    watch-less --help
[/code]
